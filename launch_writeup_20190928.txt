Hi guys,

Relating to yesterday's launch of video -> mp4 tool, I've written another tool that converts image sequences into MP4!

ImgSeq2Mp4 is a tool that converts image sequences inside a specific folder into MP4.

Simply drag a folder from the explorer onto the a_imgSeq2mp4 icon on your launcher, and an MP4 file will be created at the same path as your folder.

If the folder contains multiple unique sequence of images, a corresponding number of MP4 movies will be created for you!
